      <p><h2>Dogs are pretty cool.</h2>  We like dogs.  When we see a dog, we're like "HEY! That's a cool dog."  Almost every time.  Cats think they're cooler, but FACT: they're not. Is there anything in the world more awesome than dogs? Yes. Puppies.  There's nothing better than cute little puppies. Except making one of them your fuzzy little buddy.  That's kinda our thing. </p>
