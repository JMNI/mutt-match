      <p>Dogs are cool.  We like dogs.  When we see a dog, we're like "Hey that's a cool dog."  Almost all of the time.  Cats are cool too, but not as cool as dogs.  The only thing better than dogs are puppies.  There's nothing better than cute little puppies. Except making one of them your fuzzy little buddy.  That's kinda like what we do.</p>
